Amphistomaty occurs predominantly in fast-growing herbaceous annuals and in slowgrowing perennial shrubs and trees. Here we present the current understanding and hypotheses on the costs and benefits of amphistomaty related to water and CO2 transport in contrasting leaf morphologies. First, there is no evidence that amphistomatous species achieve higher stomatal densities on a projected leaf area basis than hypostomatous species, but two-sided gas exchange is less limited by boundary layer effects. Second, amphistomaty may provide a specific advantage in thick leaves by shortening the pathway for CO2 transport between the atmosphere and the chloroplasts. In thin leaves of fast-growing herbaceous annuals, where both the adaxial and abaxial pathways are already short, amphistomaty enhances leaf-atmosphere gas exchange capacity. Third, amphistomaty may help to optimise the leaf interior water status for CO2 transport by reducing temperature gradients and thereby preventing the condensation of water which could limit CO2 diffusion. Fourth, a potential cost of amphistomaty is the need for additional investments in leaf water transport tissue to balance the water loss through the adaxial surface.},

	abstract = {The capacity of plants to ﬁx carbon is ultimately constrained by two core plant attributes: photosynthetic biochemistry and the conductance to CO2 diffusion from the atmosphere to sites of carboxylation in chloroplasts, predominantly stomatal conductance. Analysis of fossilized plant remains shows that stomatal density (number per unit area, D) and size (length by width, S) have ﬂuctuated widely over the Phanerozoic Eon, indicating changes in maximum stomatal conductance. Parallel changes are likely to have taken place in leaf photosynthetic biochemistry, of which maximal rubisco carboxylation rate, Vcmax is a central element. We used measurements of S and D from fossilized plant remains spanning the last 400 Myr (most of the Phanerozoic), together with leaf gas exchange data and modeled Phanerozoic trends in atmospheric CO2 concentration, [CO2]a, to calibrate a [CO2]a-driven model of the long-term environmental inﬂuences on S, D and Vcmax. We show that over the Phanerozoic large changes in [CO2]a forced S, D and Vcmax to co-vary so as to reduce the impact of the change in [CO2]a on leaf CO2 assimilation for minimal energetic cost and reduced nitrogen requirements. Underlying this is a general negative correlation between S and D, and a positive correlation between water-use efﬁciency and [CO2]a. Furthermore, the calculated steady rise in stomatal conductance over the Phanerozoic is consistent with independent evidence for the evolution of plant hydraulic capacity, implying coordinated and sustained increase in gas exchange capacity and hydraulic capacity parallel long-term increases in land plant diversity.},

	abstract = {Maximum stomatal conductance to water vapour and CO2 (gwmax, gcmax, respectively), which are set at the time of leaf maturity, are determined predominantly by stomatal size (S) and density (D). In theory, many combinations of S and D yield the same gwmax and gcmax, so there is no inherent correlation between S and D, or between S, D and maximum stomatal conductance. However, using basic equations for gas diffusion through stomata of different sizes, we show that a negative correlation between S and D offers several advantages, including plasticity in gwmax and gcmax with minimal change in epidermal area allocation to stomata. Examination of the relationship between S and D in Eucalyptus globulus seedlings and coppice shoots growing in the ﬁeld under high and low rainfall revealed a strong negative relationship between S and D, whereby S decreased with increasing D according to a negative power function. The results provide evidence that plasticity in maximum stomatal conductance may be constrained by a negative S versus D relationship, with higher maximum stomatal conductance characterized by smaller S and higher D, and a tendency to minimize change in epidermal space allocation to stomata as S and D vary.},

	abstract = {The ability to discriminate between open vegetation and closed forest in the fossil record is constrained by a paucity of suitable proxies. Taxonomy-based proxies (especially the ﬂoristic composition of fossil pollen assemblages) provide the main tool for inferring vegetation type but this approach can be confounded by evolutionary changes in ecology, especially for ancient fossil assemblages. This paper considers a range of indicators of open vegetation that can be observed on fossil leaves. We show that the presence of amphistomatic leaves (i.e. leaves with stomata on both upper and lower surfaces) is unambiguously associated with open vegetation in the ecologically diverse family Proteaceae. This linkage shows very high levels of evolutionary convergence and the relationship is not explained by climate. Similar relationships are also present in a wide range of other plant groups. The combination of these empirical correlations and physiological theory suggests that there is a strong functional link between amphistomatic leaves and open vegetation. Theory says that amphistomy increases the efﬁciency of water transport and gas exchange by allowing two layers of high performance photosynthetic tissue to be proximal to sources of both carbon dioxide (stomata) and water (veins). However these beneﬁts come at the cost of requiring thick leaves, which are inefﬁcient in shaded environments. Other leaf characteristics observable on fossils (especially very thick cuticles, the presence of thick ligniﬁed hypodermal layers and the presence of deeply encrypted stomata) may also indicate the presence of open vegetation, although the functional links between these traits and vegetation type are more indirect. We propose that amphistomatic fossil leaves of dicotyledonous angiosperms provide a strong proxy for open vegetation but any inference will be enhanced by evidence from alternative proxies. We also provide an example of the application of this proxy.},

	abstract = {Stomata are essential for diffusive entry of gases to support photosynthesis, but may also expose internal leaf tissues to pathogens. To uncover trade-offs in range-wide adaptation relating to stomata, we investigated the underlying genetics of stomatal traits and linked variability in these traits with geoclimate, ecophysiology, condensed foliar tannins and pathogen susceptibility in black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa). Upper (adaxial) and lower (abaxial) leaf stomatal traits were measured from 454 accessions collected throughout much of the species range. We calculated broad-sense heritability (H2) of stomatal traits and, using SNP data from a 34K Populus SNP array, performed a genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to uncover genes underlying stomatal trait variation. H2 values for stomatal traits were moderate (average H2 = 0.33). GWAS identiﬁed genes associated primarily with adaxial stomata, including polarity genes (PHABULOSA), stomatal development genes (BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE 2) and disease/wound-response genes (GLUTAMATE-CYSTEINE LIGASE). Stomatal traits correlated with latitude, gas exchange, condensed tannins and leaf rust (Melampsora) infection. Latitudinal trends of greater adaxial stomata numbers and guard cell pore size corresponded with higher stomatal conductance (gs) and photosynthesis (Amax), faster shoot elongation, lower foliar tannins and greater Melampsora susceptibility. This suggests an evolutionary trade-off related to differing selection pressures across the species range. In northern environments, more adaxial stomata and larger pore sizes reﬂect selection for rapid carbon gain and growth. By contrast, southern genotypes have fewer adaxial stomata, smaller pore sizes and higher levels of condensed tannins, possibly linked to greater pressure from natural leaf pathogens, which are less signiﬁcant in northern ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Occurrence of stomata on both leaf surfaces (amphistomaty) promotes higher stomatal conductance and photosynthesis while simultaneously increasing exposure to potential disease agents in black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa).  A genome-wide association study (GWAS) with 2.2M SNPs generated through whole genome sequencing found 280 loci associated with variation in adaxial stomatal traits, implicating genes regulating stomatal development and behaviour. Strikingly, numerous loci regulating plant growth and response to biotic and abiotic stresses were also identified.  The most significant locus was a poplar homolog of SPEECHLESS (PtSPCH1). Individuals possessing PtSPCH1 alleles associated with greater adaxial stomatal density originated primarily from environments with shorter growing seasons (e.g. northern latitudes, high elevations) or with less precipitation. PtSPCH1 was expressed in developing leaves but not developing stem xylem. In developing leaves, RNA-seq showed patterns of coordinated expression between PtSPCH1 and other GWAS-identified genes.  The breadth of our GWAS results suggests that the evolution of amphistomaty is part of a larger, complex response in plants. Suites of genes underpin this response, retrieved through genetic association to adaxial stomata, and show co-ordinated expression during development. We propose that the occurrence of amphistomaty in P. trichocarpa involves PtSPCH1 and reflects selection for supporting rapid growth over investment in immunity.},

	abstract = {Natural selection on photosynthetic performance is a primary factor determining leaf phenotypes. The complex CO2 diffusion path from substomatal cavities to the chloroplasts – the mesophyll conductance (gm) – limits photosynthetic rate in many species and hence shapes variation in leaf morphology and anatomy. Among sclerophyllous and succulent taxa, structural investment in leaves, measured as the leaf dry mass per area (LMA), has been implicated in decreased gm. However, in herbaceous taxa with high gm, it is less certain how LMA impacts CO2 diffusion and whether it signiﬁcantly affects photosynthetic performance. We addressed these questions in the context of understanding the ecophysiological signiﬁcance of leaf trait variation in wild tomatoes, a closely related group of herbaceous perennials. Although gm was high in wild tomatoes, variation in gm signiﬁcantly affected photosynthesis. Even in these tenderleaved herbaceous species, greater LMA led to reduced gm. This relationship between gm and LMA is partially mediated by cell packing and leaf thickness, although amphistomy (equal distribution of stomata on both sides of the leaf) mitigates the effect of leaf thickness. Understanding the costs of increased LMA will inform future work on the adaptive signiﬁcance of leaf trait variation across ecological gradients in wild tomatoes and other systems.},

A total of 285 previously published SD and 145 SI responses to variable CO2 concentrations from a pool of 176 C3 plant species are analyzed here to test the reliability of this method. The percentage of responses inversely responding to CO2 rises from 40 and 36\% (for SD and SI, respectively) in experimental studies to 88 and 94\% (for SD and SI, respectively) in fossil studies. The inconsistent experimental responses verify previous concerns involving this method, however the high percentage of fossil responses showing an inverse relationship clearly validates the method when applied over time scales of similar length. Furthermore, for all groups of observations, a positive relationship between CO2 and SD/SI is found in only \#12\% of cases. Thus, CO2 appears to inversely affect stomatal initiation, although the mechanism may involve genetic adaptation and therefore is often not clearly expressed under short CO2 exposure times.},

Klamina was measured for sun and shade leaves of six woody temperate species growing in moist soil, and tested for correlation with the prevailing leaf irradiance, and with 22 other leaf traits. Klamina varied from 7.40 ¥ 10-5 kg m-2 s-1 MPa-1 for Acer saccharum shade leaves to 2.89 ¥ 10-4 kg m-2 s-1 MPa-1 for Vitis labrusca sun leaves. Tree sun leaves had 15–67\% higher Klamina than shade leaves. Klamina was co-ordinated with traits associated with high water ﬂux, including leaf irradiance, petiole hydraulic conductance, guard cell length, and stomatal pore area per lamina area. Klamina was also co-ordinated with lamina thickness, water storage capacitance, 1/mesophyll water transfer resistance, and, in ﬁve of the six species, with lamina perimeter/area. However, for the six species, Klamina was independent of inter-related leaf traits including leaf dry mass per area, density, modulus of elasticity, osmotic potential, and cuticular conductance. Klamina was thus co-ordinated with structural and functional traits relating to liquid-phase water transport and to maximum rates of gas exchange, but independent of other traits relating to drought tolerance and to aspects of carbon economy.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
          
            Natural selection can remove maladaptive genotypic variance from populations, leaving reduced phenotypic variation as a signal of its action. Hybrid populations offer a unique opportunity to study phenotypic variance before selection purifies it, as these populations can have increased genotypic and phenotypic variance than can reveal trade-offs and selection conflicts not visible, or visible to a lesser extent, in unadmixed populations. Here, we study the interactions between a fungal leaf rust disease (
            Melampsora medusae
            ) and stomata and ecophysiology traits in a set of hybrid and unadmixed individuals formed by natural matings between
            Populus balsamifera
            ,
            P. trichocarpa
            ,
            P. angustifolia
            , and
            P. deltoides
            . Phenotypes were measured on cloned genotypes grown in a common garden and genotyped at 227K SNPs with GBS. Our analyses indicate hybridization decreases disease resistance and increases the variance of stomatal ratio (SR), or the ratio of upper leaf surface stomata density to total stomata density. Heritability of SR was high in admixed populations (
            H
            2
            = 0.72) and covaries strongly with the proportion of
            P. balsamifera
            ancestry in a genome; thus, selection could effectively reduce disease by selecting for low values of stomatal ratio. However, selection conflicts present in some admixed populations may prevent adaptation to pathogens as a result of these populations being unable to occupy adaptive trait space along the growth-defense spectrum. These results suggest an important role for SR and stomatal patterning traits as a target of pathogen induced selection to achieve local fitness optima. Additionally, we demonstrate that hybridization is capable of generating, or magnifying maladaptive intermediate phenotypes to reveal trade-offs and selection conflicts.},
